Subject: Request for Planned Leaves in February

Dear [Manager’s Name] and [Scrum Master’s Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you about my planned leaves in February as I will be traveling to my hometown after a long time. I would like to take leave on the following dates:
	•	13th February (Tuesday)
	•	14th February (Wednesday)
	•	20th February (Tuesday)
	•	21st February (Wednesday)

Please note that I did not take any leaves during December when most team members were on vacation, and I have planned these dates carefully to ensure minimal disruption to the project. I will make sure to complete any pending tasks or hand over responsibilities before my leaves to avoid any impact on our deliverables.

Let me know if you need any further details or adjustments from my side.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
Shreyash Patil
