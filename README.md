### **Verification of the Rules and Test Coverage**

#### **Analysis of the Rules**
The rule checks if any of the following arrays in the `entityDetailsCollection` have missing or null values in critical properties (`proposedLimitCeiling`, `proposedTenor`, `proposedTenorType`):

1. **Arrays:**
   - `gflAppetiteDetails`
   - `gslAppetiteDetails`
   - `thereOfPrimary`
   - `thereOfTradingCollateralized`
   - `thereOfTradingUnCollateralized`

2. **Conditions Checked:**
   - `entityDetailsCollection` must not be null or empty.
   - Each of the arrays within `entityDetailsCollection` must not be null or empty.
   - For each element in the arrays, the following fields are validated:
     - `proposedLimitCeiling`
     - `proposedTenor`
     - `proposedTenorType`

3. **Validation Error Message:**
   If any of the conditions fail, the following message is triggered:
   ```
   Please make sure values are entered in all fields referring to proposed limit and tenor ceilings.
   ```

### **Verification**

#### **1. Validity of the Rules**
- The rules are **syntactically correct** and logically validate the defined conditions.
- However, some areas require clarity and edge-case handling:
  - **Clarity of Fields:** What is the expected behavior if all arrays are valid, but only one field (e.g., `proposedLimitCeiling`) is consistently null across all elements?
  - **Empty vs Null:** Are empty strings (`""`) treated as invalid, or only null values?

#### **2. Edge Cases**
The following edge cases must be explicitly tested:

| **Scenario**                           | **Edge Case**                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Empty `entityDetailsCollection`        | If `entityDetailsCollection` is empty, the rule will fail silently. Ensure validation for an empty collection explicitly prompts an error.                                                                                            |
| Null Array in `entityDetailsCollection` | If any of the arrays (`gflAppetiteDetails`, etc.) is null while others are populated, the rule may not validate properly. Ensure the rule checks each array individually.                                                              |
| Mixed Validity                         | Some arrays have valid fields, while others have missing fields. Verify if partial validation works and triggers errors for only invalid arrays.                                                                                       |
| All Fields Valid                       | Verify that no validation error is triggered when all fields are populated correctly.                                                                                                                                                  |
| All Fields Null                        | Check if the rule catches and triggers validation for all null fields across all arrays.                                                                                                                                               |
| Inconsistent Data Across Arrays        | If `proposedLimitCeiling` is null in `gflAppetiteDetails`, but populated in `gslAppetiteDetails`, does the rule handle such inconsistencies and validate independently?                                                                |
| Mixed Data Types                       | What happens if `proposedLimitCeiling` is passed as a string (e.g., `"10000"`) instead of an integer? Ensure type validation is applied where necessary.                                                                               |
| Large Collections                      | Test the rule with large collections (e.g., 10,000 elements in `entityDetailsCollection`) to ensure it performs efficiently and validates all records without skipping any due to processing constraints or incorrect loop termination. |

### **Testing Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: All Arrays Null**
```json
{
    "entityDetailsCollection": null
}
```
**Expected Result:**
- Validation error: `entityDetailsCollection is null or empty.`

#### **Scenario 2: Empty Arrays**
```json
{
    "entityDetailsCollection": []
}
```
**Expected Result:**
- Validation error: `entityDetailsCollection is null or empty.`

#### **Scenario 3: One Null Field in Each Array**
```json
{
    "entityDetailsCollection": [
        {
            "gflAppetiteDetails": [
                { "proposedLimitCeiling": null, "proposedTenor": 10, "proposedTenorType": "A" }
            ],
            "gslAppetiteDetails": [
                { "proposedLimitCeiling": 100, "proposedTenor": null, "proposedTenorType": "B" }
            ],
            "thereOfPrimary": [
                { "proposedLimitCeiling": 200, "proposedTenor": 20, "proposedTenorType": null }
            ],
            "thereOfTradingCollateralized": [
                { "proposedLimitCeiling": null, "proposedTenor": null, "proposedTenorType": null }
            ],
            "thereOfTradingUnCollateralized": [
                { "proposedLimitCeiling": null, "proposedTenor": null, "proposedTenorType": null }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
**Expected Result:**
- Validation error triggered for each null or missing field:
  ```
  Please make sure values are entered in all fields referring to proposed limit and tenor ceilings.
  ```

#### **Scenario 4: Mixed Validity**
```json
{
    "entityDetailsCollection": [
        {
            "gflAppetiteDetails": [
                { "proposedLimitCeiling": 100, "proposedTenor": 10, "proposedTenorType": "A" }
            ],
            "gslAppetiteDetails": [
                { "proposedLimitCeiling": null, "proposedTenor": 20, "proposedTenorType": "B" }
            ],
            "thereOfPrimary": [],
            "thereOfTradingCollateralized": [
                { "proposedLimitCeiling": 200, "proposedTenor": 30, "proposedTenorType": "C" }
            ],
            "thereOfTradingUnCollateralized": [
                { "proposedLimitCeiling": null, "proposedTenor": null, "proposedTenorType": null }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
**Expected Result:**
- Validation error triggered for:
  - `gslAppetiteDetails` (missing `proposedLimitCeiling`)
  - `thereOfTradingUnCollateralized` (all fields null)

#### **Scenario 5: Large Collection**
```json
{
    "entityDetailsCollection": [
        {
            "gflAppetiteDetails": [ /* 10,000 records with mixed validity */ ],
            "gslAppetiteDetails": [ /* 10,000 records with mixed validity */ ],
            ...
        }
    ]
}
```
**Expected Result:**
- Validation is applied to all records without performance degradation.

### **Improvements to the Rule**
1. **Explicit Validation for Null Arrays:**
   - Add a check for arrays being null before validating their elements.

2. **Type Validation:**
   - Ensure that `proposedLimitCeiling` and `proposedTenor` are of the correct type (integer).

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - Handle cases where `entityDetailsCollection` is empty or partially populated.

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Optimize validation for large collections to prevent excessive resource consumption.

If you'd like, I can help simulate these scenarios programmatically or refine the rule implementation further. Let me know!
