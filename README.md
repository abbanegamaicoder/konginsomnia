“Implemented auto-approval for Discretion Assignment when the submitter is also an approver. Added isAutoApprove flag, verified submitter against the approver list, and auto-closed the child process with enum code 12. Updated the completion API to pass actionCode and requestedBy. Validated functionality—marking JIRA as complete.”

Closing Comment: Implemented recipient handling in withdraw and auto-approval flows by fetching the username attribute, mapping it to the recipient ID process variable, and defining it as an actor in the workflow. Ensured requests are withdrawn by recipient ID or auto-approved (action code 12) if the recipient is in the approver list. Applied necessary checks for withdraw, reject, and auto-approval states. Testing completed successfully. Closing this JIRA.
