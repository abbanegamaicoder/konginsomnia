“Implemented auto-approval for Discretion Assignment when the submitter is also an approver. Added isAutoApprove flag, verified submitter against the approver list, and auto-closed the child process with enum code 12. Updated the completion API to pass actionCode and requestedBy. Validated functionality—marking JIRA as complete.”
