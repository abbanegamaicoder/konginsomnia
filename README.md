Workflow”:
	•	Scenario: Trigger the workflow for all teams when the input is -1.
	•	Given: The input value for teams is -1 and the entity contains fields like BE, BUK, etc.
	•	When: The workflow execution is initiated.
	•	Then: The workflow is triggered for all teams and processes all fields in the specified entity.



Acceptance Criteria for “Withdraw Workflow Issue Fixed”:
	•	Scenario: Ensure the workflow completes correctly when either the Submitter withdraws or the Approver takes action.
	•	Given: A workflow with Submitter and Approver user tasks is active.
	•	When: Either the Submitter withdraws or the Approver takes action.
	•	Then: The corresponding user task is completed, the other user task is aborted or suspended, and the workflow reaches the end node and completes successfully.



Closing Comment for Request Approved:
Implemented and tested the “Request Approved” functionality by identifying approvers, generating task IDs via the task generation API, and ensuring task creation and completion through the workflow. Verified the solution across scenarios and inputs (e.g., CA, additional role, watch list) for multiple teams, confirming approval tasks work as expected. Used enum 12 for approval. Exposed all relevant task APIs to the gateway, meeting the acceptance criteria.

Closing Comment for Request Rejected:
Implemented and tested the “Request Rejected” functionality by identifying approvers, generating task IDs via the task generation API, and ensuring task creation and completion through the workflow. Verified the solution across scenarios and inputs (e.g., CA, additional role, watch list) for multiple teams, confirming rejection tasks work as expected. Used enum 45 for rejection. Exposed all relevant task APIs to the gateway, meeting the acceptance criteria.
Closing Comment:
Implemented a new “Withdraw” state for the submitter in the child workflow, allowing them to withdraw a request. Added logic to dynamically abort or suspend the approver’s or submitter’s user task based on actions taken on either task. After analysis, found that the Suspend API caused the process instance to remain active despite reaching the end node. Resolved the issue by ensuring proper task completion and process termination.
